  "body": "This version is for RUMBA boards\r\n\r\nIt is setup for:\r\n- 3 extruders\r\n- The RepRapDiscount FULL GRAPHIC Smart Controller (quadratic white PCB)       http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRapDiscount_Full_Graphic_Smart_Controller\r\n- French language\r\n\r\nI will publish evolutions and update here above specs according to the evolution of my personal config.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version is based on the following:\r\n\r\n# Marlin 3D Printer Firmware\r\n\r\n## Release Candidate -- Marlin 1.1.0-RC5 RCBugFix - 03 April 2016\r\n\r\n__Not for production use – use with caution!__\r\n\r\nYou can download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases). (The latest \"stable\" release of Marlin is 1.0.2-1.)\r\n\r\nYou'll always find the latest Release Candidate in the [\"RC\" branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC). Bugs that we find in the current Release Candidate are patched in the [\"RCBugFix\" branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RC), so during beta testing this is where you can always find the latest code on its way towards release.\r\n\r\nFuture development (Marlin 1.2 and beyond) takes place in the [MarlinDev repository](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev/).\r\n\r\n## Recent Changes\r\n- RC4 - 24 Mar 2016\r\n  - Many lingering bugs and nagging issues addressed\r\n  - Improvements to LCD menus, CoreXY/CoreXZ, Delta, Bed Leveling, and more…\r\n\r\n- RC3 - 01 Dec 2015\r\n  - A number of language sensitive strings have been revised\r\n  - Formatting of the LCD display has been improved to handle negative coordinates better\r\n  - Various compiler-related issues have been corrected\r\n\r\n- RC2 - 29 Sep 2015\r\n  - File styling reverted\r\n  - LCD update frequency reduced\r\n\r\n- RC1 - 19 Sep 2015\r\n  - Published for testing\r\n\r\n## Submitting Patches\r\nProposed patches should be submitted as a Pull Request against the [RCBugFix](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/RCBugFix) branch.\r\n\r\n- Don't submit new feature proposals. The RCBugFix branch is for fixing bugs in existing features.\r\n- Do submit questions and concerns. The \"naive\" question is often the one we forget to ask.\r\n- Follow the proper coding style. Pull requests with styling errors will be delayed. See our [Coding Standards](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/wiki/DNE-Coding-Standards) page for more information.\r\n\r\n## Current Status: Testing\r\n\r\nPlease test this firmware and inform us if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!\r\n\r\n[![Coverity Scan Build Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2224/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/2224)\r\n[![Travis Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/MarlinFirmware/MarlinDev)\r\n\r\n##### [RepRap.org Wiki Page](http://reprap.org/wiki/Marlin)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nThe current Marlin dev team consists of:\r\n\r\n - Scott Lahteine [@thinkyhead] - English\r\n - [@Wurstnase] - Deutsch, English\r\n - F.

The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.\r\n\r\nWhile we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.\r\n\r\n[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=ErikZalm&url=https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin&title=Marlin&language=&tags=github&category=software)\r\n",
